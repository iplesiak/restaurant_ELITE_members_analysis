What variables affect the timing of a customer becoming 2 a member of the yelpâ€™s Elite Squad? Duration & Poisson Regression models.

How are the total number of tips and the number of reviews a customer gives affected by variables in the dataset?

Against my expectations the timing of becoming an Elite member is affected positively by the amount of negative reviews a user is 
writing, but since the positive reviews cause multicollinearity it can be assumed that positive reviews have an even higher impact on the timing. 
This can be confirmed with the positive impact of average stars, meaning the higher the stars a user is giving, the higher the probability 
of becoming an Elite member earlier. It can also be confirmed that active users can be measured based on the amount of reviews and tips they write. 
Furthermore, it was discovered that Elite members seem to be heavy users with a larger amount of tips and reviews. It was discovered that the number 
of heavy users is decreasing over time, meaning that the number of reviews and tips will go down, assuming that the users get less engaged. 
Therefore Managers should focus on reward programs for an active long-lasting relationship, focusing on their loyal long term users. 
Concerning the longevity of the relationship between users and Yelp, it was discovered that the number of years users are Elite members, are positively
affected by positive exchange with other members (personal compliments), fans, funny and cool. Compliments referring to the writing 
style and the reviews can make people feel obligated to change something and therefore does not motivate people to stay Elite members. 
Following these observations, it can assumed that Yelp users prefer personal interactions from friends and positive feedback on their 
yelping in order to stay an active Elite member. This could be solved with motivational letters on a regular basis 
for the Yelp users, as well through quick Like and vote options, similar to Facebook motivating the other users to leave a quick positive 
reaction. All in all, it can said that Elite members really are an asset for Yelp since they are the most active heavy users with mostly 
positive reviews. Furthermore, they seem to be trustworthy for other Yelp users. Therefore, Managers should focus on reward programs keeping 
the long term users as happy as possible, motivating them to stay active in the long run.
